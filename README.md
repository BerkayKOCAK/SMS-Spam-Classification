# SMS-Spam-Classification
 
In this project, we are required to develop a Python notebook application based spam classifier from the SMS Spam Collection dataset and we needed to cover the following operations:

Feature Engineering
Exploratory Data Analysis
Data Preparation (Data Cleaning, Handling Outliers, etc.)
Text Vectorization (CountVectorizer, TfidfVectorizer, Word2Vec, etc)
Model Building
Ensemble Learning with the models built (Voting Classifier)
Parameter Tuning
Comparative Performance Analysis (Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, F-Measure, AUC, etc.)
Conclusions (Report best performing classifier, features, etc.)
